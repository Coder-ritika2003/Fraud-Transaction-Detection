# Fraud-Transaction-Detection

Fraud Transaction Detection - TechnoHacks Task 3
Project Overview
🎉 Completed my third project in the Data Science internship at TechnoHacks! This project focuses on developing a fraud transaction detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help financial institutions detect fraudulent activities early and prevent financial losses.

Key Features
🔍 Data Exploration: Analyzed transaction data to understand patterns and anomalies indicative of fraud.
🤖 Machine Learning Models: Implemented various machine learning algorithms to classify transactions, including:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
📈 Model Evaluation: Evaluated models based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure effective fraud detection.
📊 Feature Engineering: Engineered relevant features to enhance model performance and detection accuracy.
Technologies Used
🖥️ Python: Programming language for data manipulation and model development.
📊 Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
🤖 Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization to understand data distribution and model performance.
